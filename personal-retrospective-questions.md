# Personal Retrospective Questions
- Am I happy doing what I'm doing right now? Scale of 1-10 and can't use 7.
- What would I do if I knew for sure it wouldn't fail?
- What would I do even if I knew it was going to fail?
- What am I doing right now because I think I should do it?
- What have I done to build the world I wish existed?
- Whose opinion steered my course this week?
- What's the one thing I need to accomplish next week?
- Last week, how often did I do things I actively enjoyed?
- How did that compare to the week before?
